# Open Mics Tracker

As they say, necessity is the mother of all inventions, this project was also born out of necessity. As a standup comedian, I regularly perform at shows called OPEN MICS, where a comedian can test their new jokes and comedy fans can attend
these at minimal or no cost at all. I realised that the current 'OPEN MIC SCENE' of Delhi is a very scattered system run through WhatsApp groups only, which
makes it a very tiring process for performers and audience to decide which venue is the most suitable for them. So we decided to make a website that makes this
process much more organised, efficient and easy so that comedians, as well as audiences, can conveniently choose which venue would be the most suitable for
them.



## Features

- Displays the details of all the open mics happening in Delhi in a very concise manner, structured on the basis of day of performing/attending.
- Open Mics are displayed as icons on google maps, so we can zoom in to locate nearby landmarks/metro stations etc.
- The user can enter the day on which he/she wants to attend the open mic and all the open mics happening on that day will show up.
- Displays important details of each open mic like the spot timing,spot price,spot duration and links to the venue's social media handles.
- User can enter his location, the wesbite will display the distance as well as ETA of each open mic from user location.
